Hello folks,
Thanks for being here. 
This is a web based project which is like ecommerce site but we are trying to give the users some extra features which will make this project unique. 
This project is part of our software engineering course and we are developing this project in group.


Introduction
In our daily life we required a lot of accessories from different places. Online shopping is a platform where we can get our desire things from far and save our time. We can search what need and compare which product is better than other. So, this project is an E-commerce site by which people can buy mobile, computer, camera and some other accessories.
Problems
People can’t buy their desire things because of distance. 
Customer can’t get their product by comparing with others.
There are issues like when we order things and after receiving the order product is completely different product.
When search for things they don’t get their all product from similar Categories.

Solution
People can buy their desired product via online. If the order is confirmed by customer then product manager will send this from courier service. So, customer can easily get the product.
We will provide cash on delivery payment and then online payment by-bKash, Rocket.
They can buy product by checking review and rating.
Category will help them finding product.
If customer have any complain for the product, they can return it within 7 days.
